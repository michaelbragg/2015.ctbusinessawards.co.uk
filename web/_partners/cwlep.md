The Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership (CWLEP), which is made-up of private and public sector organisations, has attracted around &pound;300 million of funding support from the government to the area and &pound;330 million private investment to improve skills, innovation, productivity and jobs.

It is making an impact on the area&rsquo;s transport infrastructure, inward investment and creating highly-skilled jobs with Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering remaining one of its key sectors.

The four key objectives of the CWLEP, under the guidance of chairman Jonathan Browning, are:

- To drive economic growth
- To help remove barriers to economic growth
- To help create high value jobs
- To co-ordinate local government co-operation and support
