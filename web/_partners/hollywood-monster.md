### The graphics specialists with a heart

When it comes to doing things with style AND substance, leading signs and digital print specialists Hollywood Monster &mdash; one of the largest graphics solutions business in the West Midlands region &mdash; is certainly the company to go to.

For managing director Tim Andrews, it&rsquo;s all about delivering a first-class, professional service.

He and his fellow directors have invested heavily in creating a very strong brand. Among its most recent prestigious projects is the printing and design of a huge hoarding for Westfield London as the retail giant embarks on a &pound;1 billion extension and corporate marketing and branding signs at Prologis Park Ryton, including for tenants such as LG.

The company also prides itself on its fundraising and corporate responsibility.

It is an official partner to pro-cycling ladies team Matrix Fitness and has sponsored Birmingham City Football Club Ladies&rsquo; team for several seasons.
