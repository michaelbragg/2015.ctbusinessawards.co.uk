Amrik Bhabra, Managing Director of ADECS Ltd and Vice President of the WBGN Steering Group, has taken on the role of President of the Coventry and Warwickshire Chamber of

Commerce. Amrik has taken over the role from outgoing President Doug Squires, who has held the role for two years.

Amrik said that he was privileged to take on the mantle of president at a time when Coventry and Warwickshire would be celebrating events such as the Olympics coming to the region. ADECS, a provider of IT and business services and design and print services will also be celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.

Amrik has overseen the expansion, growth and diversification of ADECS since he took on a Director&rsquo;s role in 1999. He attributes a key reason why ADECS has been able to sustain the success of the company to a decision to attend Warwick Business School&rsquo;s â€“ Business Innovation and Growth programme (BIG).

Amrik Bhabra said:

> &ldquo;The key learning that this provided me with was the recognition that owner managers and directors need to &lsquo;work on the business&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;work in&rsquo; the business. This has made a major impact on our ability to deliver successful growth.&rdquo;
