Professor David Bailey, an influential business expert on economic restructuring industrial policy is perhaps best known for his knowledge of UK and West Midlands car manufacturing.

As an author, regular media commentator and newspaper columnist, he has provided articles and commentary on key economic and regional policy issues including the closure and eventual reopening of the MG Rover car plant in Birmingham, UK, and the Jaguar Land Rover economic success story.

Most recently, David has undertaken European funded research on using foreign investment to upgrade clusters and on industrial and regional policy and the rise of &rsquo;phoenix&lsquo; industries such as the low carbon vehicles cluster here in the West Midlands.

He has also recently worked with SQW Consulting on a project for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on developing a framework to assist Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) in responding to economic &rsquo;shocks&lsquo; and restructuring. He has twice chaired the Regional Studies Association, and has acted as a Special Advisor to the House of Commons Select Committee on the West Midlands region, presenting to a number of select committees and All Party Parliamentary Groups. He has also been a Non-Executive Director at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust from 2006-2013.
